##Contribute

As an attendee in the Contribute track, your submission will consist of a [devpost](https://hackillinois-2017.devpost.com/) submission and a link to a GitHub gist.

There are two cases:


1. You did not complete a PR:
That's totally okay! You do *not* have to finish a PR to submit to HackIllinois. In your submission gist, please link to any work-in-progress code (a branch, forked repo, etc.) along with the content covered below.


2. You completed a PR
Awesome! In your gist, please link to your PR and also make sure you're following the contribution guidelines to the repo you are submitting your pull request to. 
  
In both cases, we'd like you to include the following (in addition to any links) in the submission gist:
  * Issue(s) that you chose to work on.
  * Explanation of your decision making on approaching the issue
  * Discussion of your contribution's current status in the pipeline and what is remaining (if there is anything).
  * Credit others contributors (teammates with what each person worked on).

#### Examples:
* submission gist: https://gist.github.com/narendasan/a6450bc86c7a97b1cfffeea84f92d118

for completed PR: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1312 


Be prepared to talk about how the specific contribution process for your project played a role in the development of the contribution. If your PR was merged in and you had to make edits in your contribution before it was approved, explain what was changed and why.
